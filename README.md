Introduction To Biophysics (PHYS 225)
=====================================

When people ask me what it means to be a Biophysicist, my stock answer
is "I like to think like a Physicist, but am fascinated by problems
that come from Biology." **Introduction to Biophysics** is an
introduction to that mindset, summed up wonderfully by the back-cover
of [Physical Biology of the Cell][PBoC]:

> *Physical Biology of the Cell* maps the huge and complex landscape
> of cell and molecular biology from the distinct perspective of
> physical biology. As a key organizing principle, the proximity of
> topics is based on the physical concepts that unite a given set of
> biological phenomena. Herein lies the central premise: that the
> appropriate application of a few fundamental physical models can
> serve as the foundation of whole bodies of quantitative biological
> intuition, useful across a wide range of biological problems.

## Textbook(s) ##

I'm still deciding on the main (*required*) textbook. There are three
front runners at the moment:

 * [Biological Physics][BiolPhys].
 * [Physical Biology of the Cell, Second Edition][PBoC]
 * [The Molecules of Life][MolLife]

Whichever we choose, we'll use the others as significant secondary
resources. We'll use PBoC's
[companion site](http://microsite.garlandscience.com/pboc2/).

Phil Nelson has some great material on his
[website](http://www.physics.upenn.edu/~pcn/), especially the recent talks.

We will not cover the whole book; see below for a list of topics. Other people
have taught similar courses, and some have been kind enough to put
their course materials online
(e.g. [SFU](http://www.sfu.ca/phys/347/),
[Cambridge](http://www.damtp.cam.ac.uk/user/gold/teaching_biophysicsIII.html)).

For more supplemental information, we'll use Phil Nelson's
(in-progress) book [Physical Models of Living Systems][PMLS], the
whole of which is absolutely worth reading, but is more suited to an
upper-level class.

William Bialek's Biophysics:
[Searching for Principles](http://www.princeton.edu/~wbialek/PHY562.html)
is a graduate-level text, but is nice and free online.

Duke's [Biophysics](http://www.phy.duke.edu/learning-about-biophysics)
website has a nice set of pointers to other resources.

## Prerequisites ##

* One semester of calculus-based Physics is required. We'll be asking
  the question "what are the physical concepts that unite a given set
  of biological phenomena," and we'll find that a surprisingly small
  number of physical models can give us a shockingly good quantitative
  biological intuition. We do need to know some physics as background,
  and we will need to discuss rates of change.

* The two-day Python Bootcamp, led by
  [Software Carpentry](http://software-carpentry.org/) hosted on
  Earlham's campus, January 11-12, 2015 (That's the Sunday/Monday
  before Spring classes, so housing should not be a problem). The
  ability to build and tweak simple computational models *greatly*
  expands the types of questions you can ask (and answer!) by
  yourself. We will use a series of
  [IPython Notebooks](https://github.com/ipython/ipython/wiki/A-gallery-of-interesting-IPython-Notebooks)
  throughout the semester, and this two-day bootcamp will teach you
  all the Python you need to get started right away. Students with
  previous Python experience can discuss opting out with the
  instructor.

* Biol 112, "Cells, Genes and Inheritance" is *recommended* as a
  pre-requisite or co-requisite, but is **not required**. It will give
  you a broader background (and a different perspective) on the
  subject, but we'll introduce the biology as it comes up throughout
  the course.

## Modules/Topics ##

### Protein Folding ###

 * [Protein Folding Dynamics in the Cell](http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/jp501866v)

### Polymer stiffness ###

## following Nelson ##

We'll likely work through the text in order, making some attempt to
get to chapter 11, even if we have to skip some things.
