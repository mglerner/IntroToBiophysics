IntroToBiophysics
=================

When people ask me what it means to be a Biophysicist, my stock answer
is "I like to think like a Physicist, but am fascinated by problems
that come from Biology." **Introduction to Biophysics** is an
introduction to that mindset, summed up wonderfully by the back-cover
of our [textbook][PBoC]:

> *Physical Biology of the Cell* maps the huge and complex landscape
> of cell and molecular biology from the distinct perspective of
> physical biology. As a key organizing principle, the proximity of
> topics is based on the physical concepts that unite a given set of
> biological phenomena. Herein lies the central premise: that the
> appropriate application of a few fundamental physical models can
> serve as the foundation of whole bodies of quantitative biological
> intuition, useful across a wide range of biological problems.

## Textbook(s) ##

The main text (*required*) will be
[Physical Biology of the Cell, Second Edition][PBoC]. We'll make
fairly heavy use of the
[companion site](http://microsite.garlandscience.com/pboc2/).

For supplemental information, we'll primarily use Phil Nelson's
[Biological Physics](http://www.physics.upenn.edu/~biophys/), as well
as his in-progress book on computational modeling.

## Prerequisites ##

* One semester of calculus-based Physics is required. We'll be asking
  the question "what are the physical concepts that unite a given set
  of biological phenomena," and we'll find that a surprisingly small
  number of physical models can give us a shockingly good quantitative
  biological intuition. We do need to know some physics as background,
  and we will need to discuss rates of change.

* The two-day Python Bootcamp, led by
  [Software Carpentry](http://software-carpentry.org/) hosted on
  Earlham's campus, January 11-12, 2015 (That's the Sunday/Monday
  before Spring classes, so housing should not be a problem). The
  ability to build and tweak simple computational models *greatly*
  expands the types of questions you can ask (and answer!) by
  yourself. We will use a series of
  [IPython Notebooks](https://github.com/ipython/ipython/wiki/A-gallery-of-interesting-IPython-Notebooks)
  throughout the semester, and this two-day bootcamp will teach you
  all the Python you need to get started right away. Students with
  previous Python experience can discuss opting out with the
  instructor.
