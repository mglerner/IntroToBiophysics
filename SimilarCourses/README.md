### The Physics of Life

[Rahuveer Parthasarathy](http://physics-server.uoregon.edu/~raghu/), an experimental soft/condensed matter physicist atthe University of Oregon who does some interesting [work](http://physics-server.uoregon.edu/~raghu/research.html) with membranes and microscopy, [teaches](http://physics-server.uoregon.edu/~raghu/teaching.html) a non-majors course called [The Physics of Life][TOpL]. This looks like a really interesting, really well thought out class that covers about 50% macro and 50% micro material. It's pitched well at the GenEd audience, and the mathematical level is approximately high school algebra.
